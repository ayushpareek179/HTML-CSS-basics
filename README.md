## Description
The course by John Smilga is derived from the [one on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/in-depth-html-css-course-build-responsive-websites/). 
Even though the YouTube video has some sections missing at the end when compared to the Udemy course, it covers the rest, which includes the fundamental basics
of [HyperText Markup Language (HTML5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) for
web-development.

The short-lectures by CodeWithHarry pertain specifically to Flexbox and Grid in Cascading Style Sheets.
