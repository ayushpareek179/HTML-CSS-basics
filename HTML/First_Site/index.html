        <p>As an English speaker <strong>literally anywhere</strong> in the world, you must have come across the increasing usage of accented words like café, junta and piñata. It gets more bewitching, when you get to know that fiesta, tomato, mosquito, potato etc are all derived <em>verbatim</em> from a language which is spread <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_Spanish_is_an_official_language" target = "_blank">across continents and societies</a>!</p>
        <p>And, if you have grown up in a multilingual society, especially one in which the language at home is different from the language at school/work, the tendency to be curious about the people hitherto unacquainted can be overpowering.</p>
        <p>And, with the stroke of luck, which presents itself in the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic" target = "_blank">most grim times</a> in human memory, one goes on to learn about a language they had never come across in person. <em>¡Bienvenidos al mundo de español! Es un buen momento para conocer.</em></p>
